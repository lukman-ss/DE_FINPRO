# ETL Currency Rates DAG

## Overview

This Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is designed to perform an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for retrieving and handling currency rate data. It extracts data from an external API, transforms it, and then loads it into a destination, which can include both a CSV file and a PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Apache Airflow
- Dependencies defined in your Airflow environment

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `dags/etl_currency_rates_dag.py`: The Airflow DAG file that orchestrates the ETL process.
- `extract.py`: Contains the logic for data extraction.
- `transform.py`: Contains the logic for data transformation.
- `load.py`: Contains the logic for data loading.

## DAG Configuration

The Airflow DAG is configured with the following parameters:

- **DAG ID**: etl_currency_rates_dag
- **Start Date**: 2023-10-18
- **Schedule Interval**: Hourly (schedule_interval='@hourly')
- **Catchup**: Disabled (catchup=False)

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
2. Install Apache Airflow. You can use pip to install Airflow:

```bash
pip install apache-airflow
```
